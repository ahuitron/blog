Hi! I'm Alfredo, a Product Manager at Atlassian based out of San Francisco, California.
I grew up in Texas and studied Advertising and CS at UT Austin. 

I've spent the first year out of college building Beacon, a new cloud security product at Atlassian.
We're currently in Beta. I spend a lot of my free time reading, playing guitar, and building projects.
